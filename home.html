    <p>HyperText Markup Language is the computer language that facilitates website creation. The language, which has code words and syntax just like any other language, is relatively easy to comprehend and, as time goes on, increasingly powerful in what it allows someone to create. HTML continues to evolve to meet the demands and requirements of the Internet under the guise of the World Wide Web Consortium, the organization that designs and maintains the language; for instance, with the transition to Web 2.0.</p>
    <br>
    <p>HyperText is the method by which Internet users navigate the web. By clicking on special text called hyperlinks, users are brought to new pages. The use of hyper means it is not linear, so users can go anywhere on the Internet simply by clicking on the available links. Markup is what HTML tags do to the text inside of them; they mark it as a specific type of text. For example, markup text could come in the form of boldface or italicized type to draw specific attention to a word or phrase.</p>

    <h2><u>What is CSS:</u></h2>

    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colours, layout, and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the users.
        
        CSS is designed to make style sheets for the web. It is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. Now letâ€™s try to break the acronym:
        
                Cascading: Falling of Styles
                Style: Adding designs/Styling our HTML tags
                Sheets: Writing our style in different documents</p>
